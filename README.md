# Decentralized Medical Credential Verification

A blockchain-based platform for secure, transparent, and efficient verification of healthcare practitioners' credentials, qualifications, licenses, and certifications.

## Overview

The Decentralized Medical Credential Verification system provides a trusted, immutable record of healthcare professionals' qualifications and licensure status. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform enables instant verification of medical credentials, reduces administrative burden, prevents credential fraud, and enhances patient safety and trust in healthcare systems globally.

## Key Components

### Practitioner Identity Contract

The Practitioner Identity Contract establishes and maintains the verified digital identities of healthcare providers.

- Creates unique digital identifiers for healthcare practitioners
- Securely links physical identity to blockchain records
- Implements multi-factor authentication for credential access
- Maintains cryptographic proof of identity verification
- Supports privacy-preserving identity attestations
- Enables selective disclosure of identity attributes
- Interfaces with existing provider directories and healthcare systems

### Qualification Verification Contract

The Qualification Verification Contract validates and records educational and training accomplishments.

- Verifies medical degrees from accredited institutions
- Records residency, fellowship, and training completions
- Validates continuing medical education (CME) credits
- Implements cryptographic proof of credential issuance
- Maintains revocation capabilities for falsified credentials
- Supports credential verification workflows with educational institutions
- Stores authenticated documentation hashes for reference

### License Status Contract

The License Status Contract tracks the current status of professional medical licenses.

- Monitors active, expired, suspended, or revoked license status
- Records licensing board actions and disciplinary measures
- Tracks multi-state licensure and reciprocity agreements
- Implements automatic expiration notifications
- Provides real-time license verification for employers
- Maintains historical record of license status changes
- Interfaces with state/national medical boards for updates

### Specialty Certification Contract

The Specialty Certification Contract records advanced qualifications and board certifications.

- Validates board certifications in medical specialties
- Tracks subspecialty qualifications and endorsements
- Records specific clinical privileges and practice permissions
- Monitors maintenance of certification requirements
- Implements verification workflows with certification boards
- Maintains expiration dates and recertification status
- Supports granular clinical competency attestations

## Getting Started

### For Healthcare Practitioners

1. Create your decentralized identity:
   ```
   npm run create-practitioner-identity
   ```
2. Connect with your medical school, residency programs, and licensing bodies
3. Authorize credential verification requests
4. Manage your professional profile and credential sharing preferences

### For Credential Issuers (Medical Schools, Licensing Boards)

1. Establish organizational verification authority:
   ```
   npm run register-issuer
   ```
2. Set up credential issuance workflows
3. Integrate with existing credential management systems
4. Begin issuing verifiable credentials to practitioners

### For Credential Verifiers (Hospitals, Healthcare Systems)

1. Set up verification account:
   ```
   npm run register-verifier
   ```
2. Configure verification requirements by role and department
3. Implement credential verification into hiring workflows
4. Set up automated periodic re-verification

## Development
